===================

Snapshot of the source code, last updated on 2021-11-02.

The game data was taken from U30.6.1 released on 2021-08-10. The data source
I was using is no longer available, so you will have to find a new way to obtain
it. A candidate is the "PublicExport":

The challenge I can think of is to covert the mod data into machine readable
format: the PublicExport contains the mod stats in the textual representation
only, which is what you normally see in the game. Some work will be required to
be able to parse texts like "During a Wall Latch gain +60% Status Chance and
Critical Chance."
